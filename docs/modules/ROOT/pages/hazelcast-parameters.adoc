= Configuring System Properties

You can configure Hazelcast parameters using the `properties` field in the CRD spec. You can find all properties in xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast::system-properties.adoc[System Properties] document.

It is worth highlighting the following system properties:

- During a rolling upgrade, the cluster is shutdown gracefully to prevent data loss. You can configure this using the xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast::system-properties.adoc#hazelcast.graceful.shutdown.max.wait[hazelcast.graceful.shutdown.max.wait system property].

Example Configuration:

Hazelcast Platform Operator sets the following system properties to the default values, which cannot be changed:

- The final step in the xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:maintain-cluster:rolling-upgrades.adoc#rolling-upgrade-procedure[rolling upgrade procedure] is to trigger a rolling upgrade on the cluster. Hazelcast Platform Operator triggers it automatically by setting `hazelcast.cluster.version.auto.upgrade.enabled` to `true` by default.

- `hazelcast.persistence.auto.cluster.state` set to `true` by default.
